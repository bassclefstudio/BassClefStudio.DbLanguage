BassClefStudio.DbLanguage is an interpreted programming language that runs on top of the .NET platform. It provides cross-platform implementations of device-specific features (such as the file system, cameras, Bluetooth, etc.) through the use of an advanced Capabilities framework, as well as unified deployment and cross-app communication across platforms.

## BassClefStudio.DbLanguage.Core
The DbLanguage.Core project contains the code for the base system that interprets and executes Db code. This includes documentation, types, memory, methods, exceptions, etc.
